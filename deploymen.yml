####kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
apiVersion: apps/v1 #it invoke an api apps/v1
kind: Deployment  #the name of the api
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment ##using metadata name we create a deployment
###this deployment required what specfication for this deployment
spec: #specification of deployment
###once we creaste the deployment we are defining specification of the deployment
#specification is divided into three part
##1. replicaset which will create the number of pod
  replicas: 3 #it will create three pod
  ##now this three pod need to controled by the deployment
  ##once this three pod is created the replicaset need to find which pod to manage
  ##kubernetes to do mapping they use a simpel basic mather called label and selector
#second is selector purpose of selector is to connect the pod with your deployment using label
  selector:

    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  

      ##app: mysql
      ###spec.selector.matchLabels it is like an map of key value pair 
  ##we need to laucn container inside all this three pod. 
  ###to do the same we will create something called as template
  ###all the three pod we have created will have similar configuration we pass the similar configuration using 
  #$##template block
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-template
  ##this template need to be maped with your pod
      labels: 
        app: myapp
    spec: #this is the specification about your template 
      containers:
        - name: myweb 
          image: nginx:1.16.1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
